Based on the above data table, Thailand is a country that has been recorded to have a significant decrease in the number of visitors in the period 2019 to 2020 compared to other Asian countries in the region. This unexpected decrease may come from restrictions on national immigration laws or even from difficulties caused by the epidemic leading to travel restrictions, causing this decrease because Thailand is famous for tourism, so the above decrease causes a lot of damage and difficulties for the country during this period.
